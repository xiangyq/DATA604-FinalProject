===================================================
This is a final group project for DATA 604 class. The members in the group are Erik Nylander, Tulasi Ramarao and Youqing Xiang. 

In this Project, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation model for heart diesease progession and then studied the model in R and Simio. At the end, we came up the strategies to slow down the progession of heart disease. For detailed final result,check the files in **Final Presentation** folder.
